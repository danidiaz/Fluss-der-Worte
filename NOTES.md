[Why do we use web.xml?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4538846/why-do-we-use-web-xml)

[The Deployment Descriptor: web.xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/config/webxml)

> Java web applications use a deployment descriptor file to determine how URLs
> map to servlets, which URLs require authentication, and other information.
> This file is named web.xml, and resides in the app's WAR under the WEB-INF/
> directory. web.xml is part of the servlet standard for web applications.

[What is WEB-INF used for in a Java EE web application?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19786142/what-is-web-inf-used-for-in-a-java-ee-web-application)

> Anyway, WEB-INF is the folder just under the root of a WAR that holds
information that you don't want to be accessible to a client via a URL request.
Specifically, it holds the web.xml, classes, and lib directories, but you can
put anything you want to hide from the client there.

> META-INF is what discriminates a JAR file from a plain ZIP file. It holds the
manifest file and may hold other deployment information as needed.

[EJB explanation regarding EAR vs WAR](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3923514/ejb-explanation-regarding-ear-vs-war)

> The EJB module is assembled into a JAR, lets call it myapp-ejb.jar as a naming
convention.

> This contains the EJB code as well as the deployment descriptor file called
ejb-jar.xml in EJB 2.x. In EJB 3.0, the code itself contains the annotations
required for the server to understand for deployment, so the deployment
descriptors are optional. The deployment descriptor/annotations cover basic
stuff needed for EJB deployment like the JNDI, DataSource look up etc.

> A collection of multiple EJB modules and other Web modules (war) together make
up an EAR. As @Isaac pointed out, an EAR doesn't have to include any WAR file
in it. The only condition for an EAR file is to contain at least one J2EE
module of any kind.

> The EAR needs a META-INF/application.xml which lists all the EJB jars and wars
present in the EAR. So you go for an EAR when you have multiple EJB modules
which is usually the case, hence the usual deployment is of an EAR.

[Packaging EJB in JavaEE 6 WAR vs EAR](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4441237/packaging-ejb-in-javaee-6-war-vs-ear)

> A key aspect of this separation is that those two modules are isolated via a
class loader hierarchy. The Web module has access to resources (typically
beans) from the EJB module, and the EJB module can reference resources
(typically libraries) defined in the overall EAR umbrella. The other direction
is not possible. Specifically, the EJB module cannot access any resources
defined in the Web module.

> This enforcement is deliberate.

[What is the preferred way to use EJBs and Servlets for web applications?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6480175/what-is-the-preferred-way-to-use-ejbs-and-servlets-for-web-applications)

[Java EE Architecture - Where do CDI Beans belong to?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43680548/java-ee-architecture-where-do-cdi-beans-belong-to/43731153)

> CDI has it's own container, so if that helps you, you can imagine the beans
sitting in their own container. And why do they have their own container? Well,
because it takes care about the lifecycle, much as an EJB container does.
On-demand bean creation and destruction, injection of dependencies... But with
CDI, the container is usually "scoped" (no connection to CDI scopes here!) per
application deployed. E.g. on your application server, you will have such a
container for each WAR, whereas with EJB there will be one container only
(after all, that's why you can have remote interfaces and jndi lookup).

> However you imagine it, the borders are indeed blurred and one of the reasons
for that is that any EJB bean is automatically a CDI bean too. Meaning you now
have them sitting in two containers at a time (it's only proxies, but still).

> Tier-wise, CDI can be anywhere - ranging from database layer (handling entity
managers as beans), over a business layer alongside EJB up to presentation
layer where, in JSF, you refer the beans directly via @Named. The CDI is there
for you to turn the world into beans and you choose what will be handled by CDI
and what will not.

[POM reference](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html)

> Inheritance and aggregation create a nice dynamic to control builds through a
single, high-level POM. You will often see projects that are both parents and
aggregators. For example, the entire maven core runs through a single base POM
org.apache.maven:maven, so building the Maven project can be executed by a
single command: mvn compile. However, although both POM projects, an aggregator
project and a parent project are not one in the same and should not be
confused. A POM project may be inherited from - but does not necessarily have -
any modules that it aggregates. Conversely, a POM project may aggregate
projects that do not inherit from it.

Archetypes to learn from:  

- com.airhacks:javaee7-essentials-archetype Java EE 7 project template. Clean,
  lean and minimalistic.

- org.wildfly.archetype:wildfly-html5-mobile-archetype An archetype that
  generates a Java EE 7 application using HTML5, and JAX-RS to support both
  desktop and mobile web browsers

- org.wildfly.archetype:wildfly-javaee7-webapp-ear-archetype An archetype that generates a starter Java EE 7 webapp project for JBoss Wildfly. The project is an EAR, with an EJB-JAR and WAR

Generate the projects like

```
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.wildfly.archetype -DarchetypeArtifactId=wildfly-javaee7-webapp-ear-archetype
```

[Packaging Enterprise Beans in EJB JAR Modules](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/packaging002.htm)

> Enterprise beans often provide the business logic of a web application. In
these cases, packaging the enterprise bean within the web application's WAR
module simplifies deployment and application organization. Enterprise beans may
be packaged within a WAR module as Java programming language class files or
within a JAR file that is bundled within the WAR module.

[Better CDI Alignment in JPA 2.1/Java EE 7](https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/better-cdi-alignment-in-jpa-21java-ee-7)

> A long standing open debate within the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) community is
whether entities should be able to access application services (roughly
business facades in J2EE patterns parlance) and repositories (roughly DAOs in
J2EE patterns parlance). If we think it's OK for entities to access these parts
of the application, it poses a problem in JPA and other mainstream data access
technologies - how do you inject objects into an entity? The answer today in
JPA is that you can't do that. There are good technical reasons why it's
difficult to allow CDI injection directly into JPA entities - it becomes very
difficult to figure out how to manage the entity life-cycle if it is managed by
both the CDI and JPA runtimes at the same time.

>  When writing an outer join, give careful consideration to the table from which you retrieve join columns.

> Scalar expressions yield null if any operand is null, but nulls are ignored by aggregate functions. This behavior is specified by the SQL standard, but it can still lead to some very surprising and unintuitive query results.

> As soon as you use aggregate functions in your SQL, you must be aware that empty sets might come into play. Listing 7 shows how aggregate functions react to empty sets. Apparently, COUNT returns zero whereas AVG, SUM, MAX , and MIN return null.

> Detached entities exists only to minimize the time your data is locked due to a transaction, maximizing the number of simultaneous users. Of course, this comes with a cost, and you listed them. but since merging conflicts are usually rare, people accept some rare bugs.

> Suppose a user has to update a form, you get the details of user in from through UserObject, This user object is persistent with session. Now if user doesn't submit the form, your session is open until server session expires, how long will you wait? If you have used getCurrentSession, another form request comes while previous one is not submitted, you have got dirty data now!! What if your object is waiting for a data that is to come for a web-service and it taking long enough, will you still keep session open, object persistent with session?

Includes [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2cnw8x/what_orms_have_taught_me_just_learn_sql/cjhfyfv/) by Gavin King.

Especially [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2cnw8x/what_orms_have_taught_me_just_learn_sql/cjheyec/):

> Well in fairness, we used to say it over and over again until we were blue in the face back when I was working on Hibernate. I even remember a number of times getting called into a client site where basically my only role was to give the team permission to use SQL for a problem that was clearly unsuited to ORM. To me it's just a no-brainer that if ORM isn't helping for some problem, then use something else.

> Indeed, systems like Hibernate are intentionally designed as "leaky abstractions" so that it's possible to easily mix in native SQL where necessary. The leakiness of the ORM abstraction is a feature, not a bug! It's meant to be that way, because both the object model and the relational model are valid ways of looking at the data, and both are useful! I speculate that the problem is not that ORM gets in the way of using SQL, it's rather that so many Java/C#/Ruby/Python/JavaScript developers don't have a strong enough knowledge of, or aren't sufficiently comfortable with, relational databases and the relational model. That is emphatically not the fault of ORM!

> Moreover, ORM is for OLTP applications. It's not usually appropriate for: batch processing, or analysis.

[REST Query Language with Spring and JPA Criteria](http://www.baeldung.com/rest-search-language-spring-jpa-criteria)

[Hibernate Criteria Queries](http://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-criteria-queries)

> Clearly, the main and most hard-hitting advantage of Criteria queries over HQL is the nice, clean, Object Oriented API.

> There are of course some disadvantages as well, especially around more complex joins.

> So, generally speaking, weâll have to use the best tool for the job â that can be the Criteria API in most cases, but there are definitely cases where weâll have to go lower level.

[Hibernate Best Practices](https://www.thoughts-on-java.org/hibernate-best-practices/)

> When youâre writing an SQL SELECT statement, youâre obviously only selecting the columns you need for your use case. And that shouldnât be different when you work with Hibernate. Unfortunately, a lot of developers only select entities from the database whether or not itâs a good fit for the use case.

> JPA and Hibernate support more projections than just entities. There are 3 different kinds of them, and each one has its advantages and disadvantages

> JPA and Hibernate offer multiple implicit and explicit options to define a query. None of them is a good fit for every use case, and you should, therefore, make sure to select the one that fits best.

> The Java Persistence Query Language is defined by the JPA standard and very similar to SQL. It operates on entities and their relationships instead of database tables. You can use it to create queries of low and moderate complexity.

[How to use native queries to perform bulk updates](https://www.thoughts-on-java.org/use-native-queries-perform-bulk-updates/)

> Using a native UPDATE statement is quite easy as I will show you in the next paragraph. But it also creates issues with the always activated 1st level cache and doesnât trigger any entity lifecycle events. Iâll show you how to handle these issues at the end of the post.

> The typical JPA approach would require 200 SELECT statements to fetch each Person entity from the database and additional 200 UPDATE statements to update each of them. The execution of these 400 statements and all the Hibernate-internal processing takes about 370ms on my local test setup. 

> The native UPDATE statement is executed in the database and doesnât use any entities. This provides performance benefits, but it also avoids the execution of any entity lifecycle methods or entity listeners.

> If you use a framework like Hibernate Envers or implement any code yourself that relies on lifecycle events, you have to either avoid native UPDATE statements or implement the operations of your listeners within this specific use case.

[5 tips to write efficient queries with JPA and Hibernate](https://www.thoughts-on-java.org/5-tips-write-efficient-queries-jpa-hibernate/)

> You should always use a projection that fits your use case.

> Entities are a good fit if you have to update or remove a record. They might also be ok for use cases which need to read (almost) all entity attributes. But keep in mind, that the persistence context has to manage the entities which creates an overhead compared to a DTO projection.

> DTOâs are a good fit for use cases that only need to read a record if they provide all required and no additional properties. That often requires you to create a new DTO when you implement a new use case. That is where most discussions start. You canât reuse the same DTO and data access services for all use cases if you want to optimize for efficiency.

[JPA 2.1 Entity Graph â Part 1: Named entity graphs](https://www.thoughts-on-java.org/jpa-21-entity-graph-part-1-named-entity/)

> If you apply all of the previous tips, you already avoid the most common pitfalls. But from time to time, you will still create inefficient queries without recognizing it. JPA and Hibernate hide all SQL statements behind JPQL, the EntityManager, and the Criteria API. That makes them easy to use, but it also gets hard to understand all implications of your API calls.

> You should, therefore, always check the executed SQL statements when you apply any changes to your code.

> Fetching too much data is the number one performance issue for the vast majority of JPA applications.

> For read-only transactions, you should fetch DTO projections because they allow you to select just as many columns as you need to fulfill a certain business use case. This has many benefits like reducing the load on the currently running Persistence Context because DTO projections donât need to be managed. 

[17. Native SQL Queries](http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.2/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#sql)

> You may also express queries in the native SQL dialect of your database. This is useful if you want to utilize database specific features such as window functions, Common Table Expressions (CTE) or the CONNECT BY option in Oracle. It also provides a clean migration path from a direct SQL/JDBC based application to Hibernate/JPA. Hibernate also allows you to specify handwritten SQL (including stored procedures) for all create, update, delete, and retrieve operations.

> The Spring Framework has always offered sophisticated support for JPA to ease repository implementations. The support consists of helper classes to set up an EntityManagerFactory, integrate with the Spring transaction abstraction, and translate JPA-specific exceptions into Springâs DataAccessException hierarchy.

> The Spring Data JPA module implements the Spring Data Commons repository abstraction to ease the repository implementations even more, making a manual implementation of a repository obsolete in most cases. For a general introduction to the repository abstraction, see Chapter 2. This chapter will take you on a guided tour through the general setup and features of the module.

[SPRING BOOT WEB APPLICATION â PART 3 â SPRING DATA JPA](https://springframework.guru/spring-boot-web-application-part-3-spring-data-jpa/)

> Using Spring Data JPA can save you a lot of time when interacting with the database. Spring Data JPA implements the Repository Pattern. This design pattern was originally defined by Eric Evans and Martin Fowler, in their book Domain Driven Design. This is one of those time test computer science books, over a decade old, still remains relevant today.

> You donât need to use Spring Data JPA for this type of project. But using Spring Data JPA will make your life as a developer easier. A common alternative to Spring Data JPA would be to use the widely accepted DAO pattern, The DAO pattern is very similar to the Repository Pattern. The advantage of using Spring Data JPA is that youâll be writing a lot less code. Spring Data JPA works a lot like Spring Integration Gateways, where you define an interface, and Spring provides the implementation at run time.

[What is the difference between DAO and Repository patterns?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8550124/what-is-the-difference-between-dao-and-repository-patterns)

> DAO is an abstraction of data persistence. Repository is an abstraction of a collection of objects.

> DAO would be considered closer to the database, often table-centric. Repository would be considered closer to the Domain, dealing only in Aggregate Roots. A Repository could be implemented using DAO's, but you wouldn't do the opposite.

[Donât use DAO, use Repository](https://thinkinginobjects.com/2012/08/26/dont-use-dao-use-repository/)
